This system detects subtle head movements to infer attention states—distinguishing between focused work, drowsiness, or distraction—without recording or storing sensitive video data. 

Beyond detection, StudyLens provides value through actionable insights. Students receive real-time nudges when attention drifts and access detailed analytics about their study habits over time.

Recognizing that traditional inventory systems—spreadsheets, manual stock checks, and fragmented tools—create inefficiencies and errors, I built a unified platform that centralizes product data, stock tracking, and analytics in a single, intuitive interface. The dashboard serves inventory managers, warehouse staff, and business owners who need real-time visibility into their product catalog and stock levels.\n\nI architected the application using **React and TypeScript for type-safe frontend development**, **Laravel for robust backend API services**, and **TailwindCSS for a modern, responsive design system**. The technical foundation includes a **real-time data synchronization engine** that keeps inventory levels accurate across multiple locations, a **powerful search and filtering system** that handles thousands of SKUs with instant results, **role-based access control** that ensures staff only see relevant data for their responsibilities, and a **RESTful API architecture** with structured DTOs and validation to prevent data inconsistencies. The backend integrates with barcode scanners and automated stock alerts to streamline warehouse operations.\n\nThe user experience prioritizes speed and clarity. I designed **visual dashboards** with key metrics like low stock alerts, fast-moving items, and inventory value at a glance, **interactive data tables** with inline editing, bulk operations, and export capabilities, **advanced analytics** with charts showing stock trends, turnover rates, and reorder recommendations, and **responsive layouts** that work seamlessly on desktop monitors for office staff and tablets for warehouse workers. The system also features **audit trails** for tracking all inventory changes, **automated notifications** for critical stock levels, and **customizable reports** for business intelligence.

The backend ensures data integrity with transaction validation and fraud prevention mechanisms.\n\nThe user experience emphasizes trust and emotional connection.

Recognizing that manual transaction processes and fragmented inventory systems were creating bottlenecks during peak hours and causing stock discrepancies between branches, I built a unified platform that centralizes all POS operations in a fast, reliable, and user-friendly interface. The system serves cashiers processing hundreds of daily transactions, managers monitoring sales performance, and administrators overseeing multi-branch inventory and reporting.\n\nI architected the application using **Laravel for robust backend services and business logic**, **MySQL for reliable transactional data storage**, **TailwindCSS for a modern, responsive admin interface**, and **vanilla JavaScript for real-time UI updates**. The technical foundation includes a **real-time transaction processing engine** that handles concurrent orders across multiple outlets without conflicts, **role-based access control (RBAC)** with granular permissions for admin, manager, and cashier roles, **centralized inventory management** with automatic stock deduction and low-stock alerts across all branches, **comprehensive reporting system** with daily sales summaries, product performance analytics, and revenue tracking, and **secure authentication** with session management and activity logging. The backend API is optimized for high-volume transactions with database indexing and query optimization.\n\nThe user experience prioritizes speed and efficiency for busy restaurant operations. I designed **streamlined cashier interfaces** with quick product search, one-click order entry, and instant receipt generation, **real-time inventory dashboards** showing current stock levels, reorder points, and transfer requests between branches, **sales analytics** with visual charts for revenue trends, best-selling items, and peak hour analysis, **order management** with table assignments, order modifications, and kitchen display integration, and **multi-branch controls** allowing administrators to view and manage all outlets from a single dashboard. The system also features **transaction history** with detailed order logs and customer records, **discount and promotion management** with flexible pricing rules, **payment processing** supporting multiple payment methods, and **automated backup** to prevent data loss. This comprehensive POS solution reduced transaction times by 50% and eliminated inventory discrepancies across branches.',
